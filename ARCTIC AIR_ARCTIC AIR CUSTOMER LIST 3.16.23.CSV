I also explained to Mr. Castro that Freon recharge does not have warranty. 
Cesar told me to tell Mr. Castro that since a month has passed the leak should have gotten bigger. At the time of the first visit the leak was probably so small it was undetectable. We would not charge the diagnostic fee but we had to repair leak in order for this not to happen again.

, Happy Call: Customer said he was not happy about having to pay $210 for just having the technician go and check his unit. I explained that is a rate we charge all customers when it is emergency/after hours. He thinks it is a rip off and we take advantage of the situation. I apologized for how he feels., Debrief: Robert collected before going because it was an after hours/emergency.

When Robert went on Sunday after hours he charged him $210 for diagnostic per Cesar's approval. He thinks we should fix the ac for the amount he already paid. I said that amount is not reimbursable and that was our service fee for going after hours. I reminded the customer he did not do any work at his house because he has home warranty. The service fee is not a fee we charge for repairing anything it is just a diagnostic fee. , Cesar said if he calls again tell him to call Cesar and give him Cesar's number.

He covered the ducts and that is the main reason why he believes the ac was not cooling enough in Bill's office.

Jesus recommended to always have the blower motor on in order for that room to stay cool. He also mentioned to Bill that the ducts will eventually have to be replaced. Bill said that is something the corporation will have to look into. Jesus mentioned there is a good opportunity to service the 10 units they have in that area, but we will have to look into increasing the price or maintenance because there are inconveniences such as taking a water tank because there is no direct access to water.

Mr. Ambriz said to call him next month to renew his CCM., Ce revisaron todos los componentes ce checo psi statica ductos amperaje termostato el√©ctrico ce lav√≥ el condensador ce checo ductos 

Cliente aprob√≥ duct cleaning pero no aprobaron su cr√©dito 

Quiere asarlo al final de mes , Debrief: Tacho confirmed he is done. He recommended two duct cleanings one for each unit. Customer approved and financed with Ally, but Ally did not offer him anything because he is maxed out in the limit ($25,000) he can finance with Ally. Tacho spoke to Cesar regarding this and we are going to see if another financing company can finance him. , Happy Call: Mr. Ambriz was not happy with Tacho. He said that he asked Tacho to look into why one of his rooms is not cooling enough. Tacho said it was because his ducts were dirty. Mr. Ambriz said that he is upset because at the time when he bought the unit if the technicians would have told his ducts were dirty he would have opted to clean them instead of buying the No Worry Warranty. He says he is not a rich man that can keep spending that much money on his ac every time we go out to do maintenance. Mr. Ambriz said he won't leave a google review because if he leaves one he would not give us a good review. I told Mr. Ambriz I will look into this with the technician and call him back.","Anastacio Estrada Rodriguez, Cesar Rodriguez Jr.",DONE,2022-07-11 10:00am,,2022-07-12 03:09pm

Unidad deteriorada en general se recomienda reemplazar 

El evaporator coil parece que se reemplaz√≥ , Debrief: Jesus confirmed he is done with this call. Then unit is working properly but the customers complaint was that there is not enough air reaching the south side of the trailer. Also says that the unit freezes up sometimes. Jesus said the filter was very saturated and the blower wheel as well. The evap coil was clean because he believes it was changed recently. (Had signs of welding) But he suspects it freezes because the filter and blower wheel are very dirty and obstruct the air. He suspects the air doesn't reach the south side because there is some type of obstruction in the ducts. He couldn't verify because the ducts are underneath the trailer and are covered by a plastic material. so he recommend cleaning ducts, blower wheel and changing filter to start. , happy call: Asked Chris what was customers main complaint. He stated that sometimes the unit turns off. Their guy who does evaluation knows more so he will have him call me back to explain more.

He said he wants to refinance with Ally or direct with us either way he wanted a solution so he can keep the unit.  Cesar called Mr. Woodley and had a lengthy conversation.  Mr. Woodley accepted responsibility for the dispute with Ally on 3 different occasions.  He stated that after the 1st or 2nd payment he received a survey from Ally which he responded to because he was disappointed because we didn't propose 2-3 options of units and he is used to always receiving options.  He admitted we were good to him and that he just wished the lines of communication between us had been better.  He blames the language barrier.  He notes that his wife speaks broken Spanish as does he.  Again he repeated the issue was not with us rather that he is used to receiving 2-3 options for everything and we failed to provide him with more than one option.  He went on to say it was a hot day and they have health issues so he accepted the unit we sold him.  He admits he is content with the unit we sold him it's just that it seems big compared to what he used to have.  Customer also mentioned that he would have chosen a less expensive unit if given the opportunity.  Cesar then asked him if he'd like to submit the finance application again and he said yes.  We proceeded to apply for financing and he accepted the plan, funds were requested, all has been settled.
