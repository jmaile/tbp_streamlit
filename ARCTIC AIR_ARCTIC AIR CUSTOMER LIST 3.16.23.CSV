, Mr. Castro called to say the ac was not cooling again and he wanted warranty and the unit to be repaired at no cost. I explained to customer that 30 days had gone by and warranty has expired, but I would speak to supervisor to see what we could do. I also explained to Mr. Castro that Freon recharge does not have warranty. 
Cesar told me to tell Mr. Castro that since a month has passed the leak should have gotten bigger. At the time of the first visit the leak was probably so small it was undetectable. We would not charge the diagnostic fee but we had to repair leak in order for this not to happen again.

When Robert went on Sunday after hours he charged him $210 for diagnostic per Cesar's approval. He thinks we should fix the ac for the amount he already paid. I said that amount is not reimbursable and that was our service fee for going after hours. I reminded the customer he did not do any work at his house because he has home warranty. The service fee is not a fee we charge for repairing anything it is just a diagnostic fee. , Cesar said if he calls again tell him to call Cesar and give him Cesar's number.

He covered the ducts and that is the main reason why he believes the ac was not cooling enough in Bill's office. The thermostat is located far from the room that Bill says is always hot and it never reaches the desired temperature. Jesus recommended to always have the blower motor on in order for that room to stay cool. He also mentioned to Bill that the ducts will eventually have to be replaced. Bill said that is something the corporation will have to look into. Jesus mentioned there is a good opportunity to service the 10 units they have in that area, but we will have to look into increasing the price or maintenance because there are inconveniences such as taking a water tank because there is no direct access to water. 

Suggest CMP for $289 per unit. This is considering three days of work., JESUS NOTES:

Unit #2 has a electric problem and it is burning the transformer. He is recommending to fix the electrical problem and replace the transformer. Unit #3 also has a leak in the evaporator and the unit is very dirty. Tacho is recommending servicing all three units for $870 each because they are very big units.

, Debrief: Jesus confirmed he is done with this call. , JESUS NOTES:


Unidad deteriorada en general se recomienda reemplazar 

El evaporator coil parece que se reemplazó , Debrief: Jesus confirmed he is done with this call. Then unit is working properly but the customers complaint was that there is not enough air reaching the south side of the trailer. Also says that the unit freezes up sometimes. Jesus said the filter was very saturated and the blower wheel as well. The evap coil was clean because he believes it was changed recently. (Had signs of welding) But he suspects it freezes because the filter and blower wheel are very dirty and obstruct the air. He suspects the air doesn't reach the south side because there is some type of obstruction in the ducts. He couldn't verify because the ducts are underneath the trailer and are covered by a plastic material. so he recommend cleaning ducts, blower wheel and changing filter to start. , happy call: Asked Chris what was customers main complaint. He stated that sometimes the unit turns off. Their guy who does evaluation knows more so he will have him call me back to explain more.

He recommended to change the condensate motor. The contactor of the unit is not working and he is also recommending to replace it. On unit #2 the condenser motor is heating up and recommending to replace it. The unit also needs a freon recharge because it is low. The dual capacitor is weak and needs to be replaced. The customer is aware of the findings but said he will wait for the motors to stop working to replace them. Tacho could not wash the units because there was no water. The customer had a sink but the sink was not adapted for our hose. Tacho offered our plumbing services to the customer to fix his sink that is leaking and to install another water faucet appropriate for the water hose. , Happy call: Mr. Mannino was getting frustrated because as soon as Tasho left he found the hose adaptor and wanted Tasho to go back i explained Tasho doesn't have 150 ft. of hose to wash those condenser units right now. He needs to get them from the shop. Since Mr., Mannino explained he wanted some water valve services as well i explained that tomorrow we could go replace valves and finish washing the units. After everything was explained properly he felt better. He will send me picture of valves so we can give him an accurate price , Mr. Manino called back to say the technician had just left and he had already found the hose spigot and he could come back and wash the unit. I advised Mr. Manino that our technician is going out tomorrow to do the plumbing work and finish washing the units. , TACHO NOTES:

The roof is already damaged by the excessive amount of water that is dripping from the unit. The blower motor is getting wet by the water and and wants to turn off. Tacho recommended to install a secondary drain pan, to replace the blower motor, to clean the evaporator coil and replace the dual capacitor because it is weak. Tacho took a video of how the water is leaking to protect our self from future complaints. The unit also has a leak in the liquid line close to the condensate.

Mr. Woodley accepted responsibility for the dispute with Ally on 3 different occasions.  He stated that after the 1st or 2nd payment he received a survey from Ally which he responded to because he was disappointed because we didn't propose 2-3 options of units and he is used to always receiving options.  He admitted we were good to him and that he just wished the lines of communication between us had been better.  He blames the language barrier.  He notes that his wife speaks broken Spanish as does he.  Again he repeated the issue was not with us rather that he is used to receiving 2-3 options for everything and we failed to provide him with more than one option.  He went on to say it was a hot day and they have health issues so he accepted the unit we sold him.  He admits he is content with the unit we sold him it's just that it seems big compared to what he used to have.  Customer also mentioned that he would have chosen a less expensive unit if given the opportunity.  Cesar then asked him if he'd like to submit the finance application again and he said yes.  We proceeded to apply for financing and he accepted the plan, funds were requested, all has been settled.

She agreed and tech proceeded to mention to her we would replace the blower motor under warranty, customer than called the office to verify how the processed worked.  Once we informed her of the process she agreed to proceed but during this time, tech was on the phone with Cesar explaining the situation.  Per Cesar, we are to charge customer a $480 warranty fee due to her not keeping up with the maintenance every 6 months.  Cesar also instructed we explain to her we could void the extended warranty should she not keep up with the PM's and I proceeded to explain the CCM.  Customer became upset and defensive stating how everything I was telling her was not in writing and not in any contract she ever signed.  She demands a copy of the contract where it states that if she does not keep up with the PM's or purchase the CCM her warranty would be voided.  Because we can't provide this, she refused to pay anything until we show her proof in writing where she acknowledges what I told her over the phone.  Per Cesar, tech is to drop everything and leave.  I explained to customer we were leaving until further notice., Happy Call: Replacement motor was cancelled from US Air and techs put old part back and left job site., Customers email is incorrect, need to get the correct one from Anna.","Gilberto Gallegos, Joshua Meza",DONE,2023-03-15 03:35pm,,2023-03-16 03:27pm
