Finally during the recall Paul figured out he was checking the wrong unit because there was nothing wrong with the one the the manager had told him to check. Unit #2 needed a pressure switch which Paul did not have, so he bypassed the unit for now to get it going.

I explained to customer that 30 days had gone by and warranty has expired, but I would speak to supervisor to see what we could do. I also explained to Mr. Castro that Freon recharge does not have warranty. 
Cesar told me to tell Mr. Castro that since a month has passed the leak should have gotten bigger. At the time of the first visit the leak was probably so small it was undetectable. We would not charge the diagnostic fee but we had to repair leak in order for this not to happen again.

Customer wants appointment for Tuesday of next week. rr, Debrief: Jesus confirmed he is done.  He inspected the ducts because they were exposed. He covered the ducts and that is the main reason why he believes the ac was not cooling enough in Bill's office. The thermostat is located far from the room that Bill says is always hot and it never reaches the desired temperature. Jesus recommended to always have the blower motor on in order for that room to stay cool. He also mentioned to Bill that the ducts will eventually have to be replaced. Bill said that is something the corporation will have to look into. Jesus mentioned there is a good opportunity to service the 10 units they have in that area, but we will have to look into increasing the price or maintenance because there are inconveniences such as taking a water tank because there is no direct access to water. 

Suggest CMP for $289 per unit. This is considering three days of work., JESUS NOTES:
Oficina de lado norte no se mantiene fresca. 

El equipo está trabajando con normalidad se ajustó ducto para que no escape aire y se deja el blower encendido , Happy Call: Wendy wants to look into doing the preventive services I suggested for all the units at that location. She said to send over the invoice and call her back to see if she gets approved for the maintenances. Wendy also mentioned if we could look into becoming a vendor for them.

, Debrief: Tacho confirmed he is done with the diagnostic. He said he found unit #1 and unit #3 have no Freon. Unit  #1 has a leak in the evaporator. Unit #2 has a electric problem and it is burning the transformer. He is recommending to fix the electrical problem and replace the transformer. Unit #3 also has a leak in the evaporator and the unit is very dirty. Tacho is recommending servicing all three units for $870 each because they are very big units. On Unit#1 the 15 tons unit Tacho said it would be better to replace it. We need to take the tallest ladder when we go there because it is too hight., Happy Call: The customer is interested in doing the repairs. She wants to know which units are on the pep boys side and which ones are on the advanced auto parts. They only want to proceed with the repairs for the pep boys side. 

*note: I spoke to Tacho and he said he did not identify which units where on which side because they did not specify that when they sent us to do a diagnostic. Tacho said we would have to go back and do another diagnostic to map up the units and see how they are connected. We need to know if they are not connected together.

, Debrief: Jesus confirmed he is done with this call. , JESUS NOTES:


Unidad deteriorada en general se recomienda reemplazar 

El evaporator coil parece que se reemplazó , Debrief: Jesus confirmed he is done with this call. Then unit is working properly but the customers complaint was that there is not enough air reaching the south side of the trailer. Also says that the unit freezes up sometimes. Jesus said the filter was very saturated and the blower wheel as well. The evap coil was clean because he believes it was changed recently. (Had signs of welding) But he suspects it freezes because the filter and blower wheel are very dirty and obstruct the air. He suspects the air doesn't reach the south side because there is some type of obstruction in the ducts. He couldn't verify because the ducts are underneath the trailer and are covered by a plastic material. so he recommend cleaning ducts, blower wheel and changing filter to start. , happy call: Asked Chris what was customers main complaint. He stated that sometimes the unit turns off. Their guy who does evaluation knows more so he will have him call me back to explain more. ",Jesus Angulo,DONE,2022-07-19 05:11pm

He said the way the city of Calexico pays is that we do the job because it needs to be done quickly and then we receive a P.O.

Per Cesar's approval: I advised Officer Marquez that we could work with a 30 day PO, but we would have to receive it first before we go and do the work. If we receive a payment later than 30 days there will be a $100 charge.

Officer Marquez offered us a ACH payment method. This method is that we would have to fill out a form and then we would be paid directly to our bank account as soon as the work is completed. He will be sending this information to our email.,  Called yesterday afternoon and today to schedule the maintenance, but no answer.

Mr. Woodley accepted responsibility for the dispute with Ally on 3 different occasions.

He admitted we were good to him and that he just wished the lines of communication between us had been better.  He blames the language barrier.  He notes that his wife speaks broken Spanish as does he.  Again he repeated the issue was not with us rather that he is used to receiving 2-3 options for everything and we failed to provide him with more than one option.  He went on to say it was a hot day and they have health issues so he accepted the unit we sold him.  He admits he is content with the unit we sold him it's just that it seems big compared to what he used to have.
