Finally during the recall Paul figured out he was checking the wrong unit because there was nothing wrong with the one the the manager had told him to check. Unit #2 needed a pressure switch which Paul did not have, so he bypassed the unit for now to get it going.

But never used the heater, she would like a diagnostic but asked if we can work with the price. Got approval from Cesar $105 for diagnostic, Update: Ms. Villanueva said she will have to wait for diagnostic because she has too many bills. Besides she does not use heater, but she said she will call back because she still wants to know what's wrong with it. ",Robert Palacio,DONE,2022-02-21 02:57pm

92243, Debrief: Tacho confirmed he is done. No additional recommendations , Customer called that screen reads: No accessory module, talked to Cesar and talked to Tacho. Tacho called customer and decided we will reimburse $50 instead of going back to install module that it needs , Happy call: Mrs. Barnard answered the phone but Mr. Barnard made the comment in the background that service was good but price was way too high. Advised we would be issuing a $50 refund; if they had any questions or concerns they could call back. , Mr. Barnard called in last week that he ordered module and thermostat was still not working. I asked if we could go out and try to fix it with his new module free of charge, he agreed but i advised we needed a picture before i could dispatch a tech. He never sent it. Per Cesar we would try to fix it if he allowed us or if he didn't wasn't us to go we would reimburse the thermostat charges. He called in the next day that he already got a new thermostat. He came in today to return thermostat and we issued refund. He said he will call us near fall for RSPM.  ",Anastacio Estrada Rodriguez,DONE,2022-04-18 03:22pm

Cesar told me to tell Mr. Castro that since a month has passed the leak should have gotten bigger. At the time of the first visit the leak was probably so small it was undetectable. We would not charge the diagnostic fee but we had to repair leak in order for this not to happen again.

, Happy Call: Customer said he was not happy about having to pay $210 for just having the technician go and check his unit. I explained that is a rate we charge all customers when it is emergency/after hours. He thinks it is a rip off and we take advantage of the situation. I apologized for how he feels., Debrief: Robert collected before going because it was an after hours/emergency. When he arrived at location the home owner's wife told Robert he needed to leave because she was going to use her home warranty and save some money. Robert did no work there. , Cesar said we are not going to refund the customer any money because we went there and we did some work. The customer's wife was the one that told us to leave because she was going to use her home warranty. , Customer called about wanting us to go and stop by at no cost to fix his ac because his ac stopped working again. When Robert went on Sunday after hours he charged him $210 for diagnostic per Cesar's approval. He thinks we should fix the ac for the amount he already paid. I said that amount is not reimbursable and that was our service fee for going after hours. I reminded the customer he did not do any work at his house because he has home warranty. The service fee is not a fee we charge for repairing anything it is just a diagnostic fee. , Cesar said if he calls again tell him to call Cesar and give him Cesar's number.

He covered the ducts and that is the main reason why he believes the ac was not cooling enough in Bill's office.

Bill said that is something the corporation will have to look into. Jesus mentioned there is a good opportunity to service the 10 units they have in that area, but we will have to look into increasing the price or maintenance because there are inconveniences such as taking a water tank because there is no direct access to water. 

Suggest CMP for $289 per unit. This is considering three days of work., JESUS NOTES:

, Debrief: Tacho confirmed he is done with the diagnostic. He said he found unit #1 and unit #3 have no Freon. Unit  #1 has a leak in the evaporator. Unit #2 has a electric problem and it is burning the transformer. He is recommending to fix the electrical problem and replace the transformer. Unit #3 also has a leak in the evaporator and the unit is very dirty. Tacho is recommending servicing all three units for $870 each because they are very big units. On Unit#1 the 15 tons unit Tacho said it would be better to replace it.

She wants to know which units are on the pep boys side and which ones are on the advanced auto parts. They only want to proceed with the repairs for the pep boys side. 

*note: I spoke to Tacho and he said he did not identify which units where on which side because they did not specify that when they sent us to do a diagnostic.

Unidad deteriorada en general se recomienda reemplazar 

El evaporator coil parece que se reemplaz√≥ , Debrief: Jesus confirmed he is done with this call. Then unit is working properly but the customers complaint was that there is not enough air reaching the south side of the trailer. Also says that the unit freezes up sometimes. Jesus said the filter was very saturated and the blower wheel as well. The evap coil was clean because he believes it was changed recently. (Had signs of welding) But he suspects it freezes because the filter and blower wheel are very dirty and obstruct the air. He suspects the air doesn't reach the south side because there is some type of obstruction in the ducts. He couldn't verify because the ducts are underneath the trailer and are covered by a plastic material. so he recommend cleaning ducts, blower wheel and changing filter to start. , happy call: Asked Chris what was customers main complaint. He stated that sometimes the unit turns off. Their guy who does evaluation knows more so he will have him call me back to explain more. ",Jesus Angulo,DONE,2022-07-19 05:11pm

He recommended to change the condensate motor. The contactor of the unit is not working and he is also recommending to replace it. On unit #2 the condenser motor is heating up and recommending to replace it. The unit also needs a freon recharge because it is low. The dual capacitor is weak and needs to be replaced. The customer is aware of the findings but said he will wait for the motors to stop working to replace them. Tacho could not wash the units because there was no water. The customer had a sink but the sink was not adapted for our hose. Tacho offered our plumbing services to the customer to fix his sink that is leaking and to install another water faucet appropriate for the water hose. , Happy call: Mr. Mannino was getting frustrated because as soon as Tasho left he found the hose adaptor and wanted Tasho to go back i explained Tasho doesn't have 150 ft. of hose to wash those condenser units right now. He needs to get them from the shop. Since Mr., Mannino explained he wanted some water valve services as well i explained that tomorrow we could go replace valves and finish washing the units. After everything was explained properly he felt better. He will send me picture of valves so we can give him an accurate price , Mr. Manino called back to say the technician had just left and he had already found the hose spigot and he could come back and wash the unit.

The customer just put a makeshift drain and says he takes the water out with a cup. The roof is already damaged by the excessive amount of water that is dripping from the unit. The blower motor is getting wet by the water and and wants to turn off. Tacho recommended to install a secondary drain pan, to replace the blower motor, to clean the evaporator coil and replace the dual capacitor because it is weak. Tacho took a video of how the water is leaking to protect our self from future complaints. The unit also has a leak in the liquid line close to the condensate. Customer did not want to proceed with any of the recommendations because he said he does not have money. , Happy call: Mr. Barrientos had no question he said he talked to Tasho and knows that his unit is old.

Mr. Woodley accepted responsibility for the dispute with Ally on 3 different occasions.  He stated that after the 1st or 2nd payment he received a survey from Ally which he responded to because he was disappointed because we didn't propose 2-3 options of units and he is used to always receiving options.  He admitted we were good to him and that he just wished the lines of communication between us had been better.  He blames the language barrier.  He notes that his wife speaks broken Spanish as does he.  Again he repeated the issue was not with us rather that he is used to receiving 2-3 options for everything and we failed to provide him with more than one option.  He went on to say it was a hot day and they have health issues so he accepted the unit we sold him.  He admits he is content with the unit we sold him it's just that it seems big compared to what he used to have.  Customer also mentioned that he would have chosen a less expensive unit if given the opportunity.  Cesar then asked him if he'd like to submit the finance application again and he said yes.  We proceeded to apply for financing and he accepted the plan, funds were requested, all has been settled.
