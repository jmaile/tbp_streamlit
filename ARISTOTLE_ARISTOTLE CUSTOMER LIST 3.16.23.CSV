notes from engineer

âAs of yesterday Chris and I found how the lines drop down from roof to second floor making its way between to vacant space and hallway down to first floor Chris found signs of oil. Today I tested and had small  sign of refrigerant But was old oil  I open  small hole to see the pipes around some look like it was rubbing  but no holes we put nitrogen on line and wiggle pipes  around  I felt nothing or heard anything . Recommend getting 410 and more nitrogen and charged the unit  then inject it with dyed and hope to find leak with ""UV"" lightâ.

After doing all of our repairs these units are still having issues. Warehouse says its still very hot in there, looks like one of the coolers water is off because the pads are still not getting wet, and one unit is still making a squealing sound

 I was just in the warehouse, and the units in 120 and 130 are blowing much hotter than the other suites. Additionally the unit in Suite 160 is squealing really loudly when running, so the team has it shut off. 

call Robert before leaving, 2 coolers were not getting enough water to pads brushed lines

DO NOT DO ANY WORK!!!
Let office know what is still wrong with it
agent had the home warranty replace the compressor but the unit is still not working, please check that the compressor was actually replaced with a  new one, coils look like they were cleaned, and if it looks like a new whip was installed for the compressor, compressor was changed out 

the plug for compressor was not and its just wire nut on not the way its supposed to be

had a blown disconnect 30 Amp fuse replaced 
cooling 
what I would recommend  is
installing a compressor plug 
getting new capacitor for compressor
